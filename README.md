# infloAI User App Build

Please preview app here:
https://sleepy-ravine-88090.herokuapp.com/

I've used create-react-app, so the following commands can be used to interact with the build:

```shell
    npm start
    npm test
    npm run build
    npm run eject
    npm run build
```

All work has been committed on the master branch.
